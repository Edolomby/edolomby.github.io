bio: "I am a Quantitative Researcher and Applied Mathematician with a Ph.D. from École des Ponts ParisTech and University of Roma Tor Vergata. My expertise lies at the intersection of stochastic calculus, high-performance computing, and numerical methods. I specialize in modeling complex stochastic dynamics and building high-performance numerical solutions in C++ and Python, transforming advanced mathematical theory into fast, accurate pricing and risk infrastructure. With prior industry experience as a Quantitative Analyst at Enel and Risk Analyst at AXA, I am passionate about applying advanced mathematical techniques, Monte Carlo simulations, and data-driven methods to solve complex pricing, risk, and alpha-generation problems in financial markets."
