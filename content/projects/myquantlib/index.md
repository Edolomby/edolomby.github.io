This project started from my publication in SIFIN: [https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/24M1679720?af=R](High Order Approximations and Simulation Schemes for the Log-Heston Process). For pricing complex exotic derivatives and simulating complex models like affine stochastic volatility with jumps, the Monte Carlo engine of the library builds upon the basic structure of the second-order scheme for the log-Heston model developed in my research.
