abstract: We present weak approximations schemes of any order for the Heston model that are obtained by using the method developed by Alfonsi and Bally (2021). This method consists in combining approximation schemes calculated on different random grids to increase the order of convergence. We apply this method with either the Ninomiya–Victoir scheme (2008) or a second order scheme that samples exactly the volatility component, and we show rigorously that we can achieve then any order of convergence. We give numerical illustrations on financial examples that validate the theoretical order of convergence. We also present promising numerical results for the multifactor/rough Heston model and hint at applications to other models, including the Bates model and the double Heston model.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Developed High order schemes for Heston and ASVJ extensions of Heston Model, proved theoremes of rate of convergence for the scheme and the random grids bosted approximations.
